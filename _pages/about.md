## Me

My name is Steve Baker. I am an IT Consultant based in the South West of England, UK.

I've been more-or-less obsessed with IT since the age of 5, when my old man brought home a Commodore C64 and I watched him setting it up, playing Elite, then I would sit, awestruck as he painstakingly typed in a code sample from a magazine, recorded it to tape(!), ran the program, and a fully playable game appeared.

Things have moved on quite a way since then and my passion for the nuts-and-bolts of computers and software has grown with every innovation.

Right now, my main interests are:

- PowerShell
- Exchange Online/Office 365
- Azure

## What you'll find here

Anything I think might be useful to share with others, whether that be a step-by-step guide to how I overcame a challenge using PowerShell, or how I renewed an SSL certificate on an old Exchange Server, or indeed anything else I think might benefit others on my journey.
